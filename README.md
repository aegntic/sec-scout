## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start with Docker

The fastest way to get SecureScout running is with Docker Compose:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/securescout.git
   cd securescout
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file from the template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   ```

3. Edit the `.env` file with your desired configurations

4. Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

5. Access the application:
   - Frontend: http://localhost
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8001
