## Installation

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/securescout.git
   cd securescout

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install backend dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create necessary directories:
   ```
   mkdir -p logs reports data
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret
   REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
   SECURESCOUT_ENV=development
   ```

2. Adjust settings in `backend/config.py` as needed for your environment.

## Running the Application

### Start the Backend

```
cd backend
python app.py
```

The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8001`.

### Start the Frontend

```
cd frontend
npm start
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:3000`
2. Create a new scan by specifying the target URL and scan configuration
3. Monitor the scan progress in real-time
4. Review findings and generate reports
