## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start with Docker

The fastest way to get SecureScout running is with Docker Compose:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aegntic/sec-scout.git
   cd sec-scout
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file from the template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   ```

3. Edit the `.env` file with your desired configurations

4. Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

5. Access the application:
   - Frontend: http://localhost
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8001

## üîê Security Authentication System

SecureScout includes a comprehensive authentication and authorization system:

- JWT-based authentication with access and refresh tokens
- Role-based access control with predefined roles:
  - **Admin**: Full system access
  - **Manager**: User management and scan control
  - **Analyst**: Run scans and create reports
  - **Viewer**: View-only access to scan results
- API key management for programmatic access
- Secure password policies and storage
- MFA support for enhanced security

## üìä Security Scanning Architecture

The scanning architecture is designed for performance and accuracy:

- **Modular Test Framework**: Easily extend with new security test modules
- **Async-Based Scanner**: Efficient resource utilization with asynchronous execution
- **Discovery System**: Smart crawling with prioritization algorithms
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable request rates to avoid DoS-like behavior
- **Result Filtering**: Sophisticated false positive reduction
