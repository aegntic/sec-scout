## Scan Management

### Creating New Scans

To create a new security scan:
1. Navigate to the "New Scan" page
2. Enter the target URL
3. Configure scan parameters (see [Scan Configuration Options](#scan-configuration-options))
4. Click "Start Scan"

### Scan Configuration Options

#### Basic Options

- **Scan Name**: Identifier for your scan
- **Target URL**: The primary URL to scan
- **Scan Type**:
  - Quick: Fast scan covering only critical vulnerabilities
  - Standard: Balanced scan with moderate depth
  - Comprehensive: In-depth scan of all vulnerabilities
- **Scan Scope**: Determine which parts of the target to scan
  - Full Site
  - Specific Directory
  - URL Pattern (using regex)

#### Advanced Options

- **Authentication**: Configure credentials if the target requires authentication
- **Request Settings**:
  - Rate Limiting: Control requests per second
  - Request Timeout: Maximum time to wait for responses
  - User-Agent Rotation: Rotate between different user agents
  - Custom Headers: Add specific HTTP headers to requests
- **Modules Selection**: Choose which security testing modules to enable/disable
- **Crawler Settings**:
  - Crawl Depth: How deep to crawl the site structure
  - Max Pages: Maximum number of pages to scan
  - URL Exclusions: Patterns to exclude from crawling
  - Form Handling: How to interact with discovered forms

### Monitoring Active Scans

The Active Scan page displays real-time information about ongoing scans:

- Progress bar showing completion percentage
- Current scanning activity
- Discovered vulnerabilities as they are found
- Resource utilization and performance metrics
- Estimated time remaining

You can:
- Pause/resume a scan
- Adjust scan parameters during execution
- Cancel a scan if needed
- Filter real-time results by severity or type

### Scan History

The Scan History page provides a list of all previous scans with:
- Scan name and target
- Date and time of execution
- Completion status
- Summary of findings by severity
- Duration of the scan
- Actions (view details, generate reports, delete)

## Working with Vulnerabilities

### Understanding Severity Levels

SecureScout categorizes vulnerabilities into five severity levels:

1. **Critical**: Severe vulnerabilities that pose an immediate risk of compromise
2. **High**: Significant vulnerabilities that should be addressed quickly
3. **Medium**: Moderate vulnerabilities that should be fixed in due course
4. **Low**: Minor vulnerabilities with limited risk
5. **Informational**: Findings that aren't vulnerabilities but could be of interest

### Analyzing Vulnerability Details

Clicking on a vulnerability provides detailed information:

- **Overview**: Vulnerability name, type, and severity
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of the vulnerability
- **Evidence**: Proof of the vulnerability's existence
- **Request/Response**: HTTP traffic demonstrating the issue
- **Impact**: Potential consequences of exploitation
- **Remediation**: Step-by-step guidance to fix the issue
- **References**: Links to relevant resources (OWASP, CWE, etc.)

### False Positive Management

If you believe a finding is a false positive:
1. Open the vulnerability details
2. Click "Mark as False Positive"
3. Provide a reason for the classification
4. Submit for review

Administrators can:
- Review false positive claims
- Confirm or reject the classification
- Add patterns to the false positive filter

## Reporting

### Report Types

SecureScout offers several report formats:

- **Executive Summary**: High-level overview for management
- **Technical Report**: Detailed findings for technical teams
- **Compliance Report**: Tailored to specific compliance frameworks (PCI DSS, HIPAA, etc.)
- **Remediation Plan**: Prioritized action items for fixing vulnerabilities

### Customizing Reports

Reports can be customized with:
- Company logo and branding
- Executive summary content
- Inclusion/exclusion of specific vulnerabilities
- Detail level for each finding
- Appendices and supporting materials

### Scheduling Reports

Automated reporting can be configured:
1. Navigate to the Reports page
2. Click "Schedule Report"
3. Select report type and format
4. Choose frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)
5. Specify delivery method (email, download, etc.)

## System Configuration

Administrators can configure system settings:

- **General Settings**: Application name, default timeout values, etc.
- **Security Policies**: Password requirements, session timeouts, MFA settings
- **Email Configuration**: SMTP settings for notifications and reports
- **Integration Settings**: Configure webhooks and third-party integrations
- **Storage Settings**: Configure report storage location and retention policy

## Advanced Features
